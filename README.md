# Omega-Robot
My Ludum Dare 37 submission.

Can you save your robot from a hostile world?

Omega Robot is a simple 2D single room maze game where you control a robot that is in search for its missing computer chip (at the finish of the maze). 

Backstory:
Your robot's ship was shot down over a hostile lava world by a unknown species of aliens, and you must avoid them and find your computer chip that will allow you to escape their world.

Use WASD to move, F2 to take a screenshot, F11 to enter fullscreen, and Escape opens the pause menu where you can navigate with your arrow keys and Enter.

This was made using LWJGL, running from my own Engine (Flounder). This was a test run to see how well my engine could work with 2D games.

This is my first Compo, I wanted to learn from this event to do better in the future.

Thanks for checking out my game, please leave feedback; feel free to take a peek at the source code as-well!
